Varnish Accept-Language VCL
===========================

Here you will find a VCL config file for Varnish (http://varnish-cache.org)
This VCL allows you to normalize and filter all the incoming requests
Accept-Language headers and reduce them to just the languages your site supports.

*** WARNING ***
This VCL consists of C code. Your Varnish might explode. YMMV.
Don't use it in production if you don't know what you're doing.
We are using it in production, but we don't know what we're doing.

Why would you want this?
------------------------
Your site supports English and Japanese languages.
Your client browsers will send every possible Accept-Language header on Earth.
If you enable "Vary: Accept-Language" on Varnish or on your backends,
the cache hit ratio will rapidly drop, because of the huge variations
in Accept-Language contents.

With this VCL, the Accept-Language header will be "rewritten" to just
"en" or "ja", depending on your client settings. If no match occurs,
you can select a default language.

The rewritten header is "X-Varnish-Accept-Language".
You can choose to put this header back in "Accept-Language" if you wish.
In this way, the normalization will be completely transparent.

Requirements
------------

- gcc, make
- a recent perl, with `prove'
- File::Slurp CPAN module

Instructions
-------------

1) Configure the list of languages your site supports
   and the default fallback in the Makefile, *NOT* in the C code.

2) Run 'make && make test'
   You should see "All tests successful" at the end of the execution

3) Install the generated accept-language.vcl in /etc/varnish/

4) Add the following include directives at the top of your main VCL file
   (default.vcl or the name you're using).

   #include <string.h>
   #include <stdio.h>
   #include <stdlib.h>

5) Inside your vcl_recv(), add the following line:

   include "/etc/varnish/accept-language.vcl"

6) Restart Varnish

7) Cross your fingers

8) Profit !!
